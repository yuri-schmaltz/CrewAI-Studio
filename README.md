# CrewAI Studio

Welcome to CrewAI Studio! This application provides a user-friendly interface written in Streamlit for interacting with CrewAI, suitable even for those who don't want to write any code. Follow the steps below to install and run the application using Docker/docker-compose or Conda/venv.

## Features

- **Multi-platform support**: Works on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
- **No coding required**: User-friendly interface for interacting with CrewAI.
- **Conda and virtual environment support**: Choose between Conda and a Python virtual environment for installation.
- **Results history**: You can view previous results.
- **Knowledge sources**: You can add knowledge sources for your crews
- **CrewAI tools** You can use crewai tools to interact with real world. ~~Crewai studio uses a forked version of crewai-tools with some bugfixes and enhancements (https://github.com/strnad/crewAI-tools)~~ (bugfixes already merged to crewai-tools)
- **Custom Tools** Custom tools for calling APIs, writing files, enhanced code interpreter, enhanced web scraper... More will be added soon

### One-Click Deployment

## Running with Docker Compose

To quickly set up and run CrewAI-Studio using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your system.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/strnad/CrewAI-Studio.git
cd CrewAI-Studio
```

2. Create a .env file for configuration.  Edit for your own configuration:
```
cp .env_example .env
```

3. Start the application with Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

4. Access the application: http://localhost:8501

## Configuration

Before running the application, ensure you update the `.env` file with your API keys and other necessary configurations. An example `.env` file is provided for reference.

- `DB_URL` (optional): overrides the default SQLite database location. Use a
  PostgreSQL URL when deploying centrally.
- `DATABASE_ECHO` (optional): set to `true` to enable SQLAlchemy query logging
  for troubleshooting.
- `AGENTOPS_ENABLED` / `AGENTOPS_API_KEY`: enable and configure AgentOps
  telemetry.

## Project structure

The most relevant modules are documented in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
Consult it for an overview of how the Streamlit pages, persistence layer and
supporting utilities fit together.

## Versioning

The application version is tracked in [`app/__init__.py`](app/__init__.py) and
follows semantic versioning. Increment the number whenever a pull request
introduces meaningful changes so downstream deployments can detect updates.

## Troubleshooting
In case of problems:
- Delete the `venv/miniconda` folder and reinstall `crewai-studio`.
- Rename `crewai.db` (it contains your crews but sometimes new versions can break compatibility).
- Raise an issue and I will help you.
